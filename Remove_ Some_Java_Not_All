If you'd like to only remove some Java versions, you need to edit these two lines in the .ps file:

$JavaInstalled = (Get-WmiObject Win32_Product -Filter 'name like "java%"')
(Get-WmiObject Win32_Product -Filter 'name like "java%"').Uninstall()

The important part is -Filter 'name like "java%"'
By changing what is in the quotations, you can narrow down what you want to look for and uninstall.
For example if you change whats inside the quotations to "Java 7%" then you are looking for and uninstalling all versions of Java 7 and lower.
Remember to change both lines in the ps1 file.
